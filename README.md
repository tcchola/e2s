### About Us
#### What is this initiative about?
English2Success is a voluntary teaching initiative, with the aim of providing quality English education opportunities for underprivileged teens online. The teachers of this project are UWC students around the globe. The teaching is relatively easy to carry out and the details are given in the following pages of this document.

#### Main Course Objectives
Provide students with free, no strings attached conversational English education. Increase the confidence of students when it comes to speaking English. Foster cross-cultural understanding. Develop better teaching skills for teachers.

#### How the project works?
Volunteer teachers would be paired up with students from underprivileged backgrounds (anyone who cannot afford an English tutor). The teacher contacts and familiarizes themselves with the student. The teacher meets with the student online once per week to help them improve their speaking skills through conversing with the student in English. More details would be provided upon confirmation.
In addition, there are regular meetings between teachers to ensure everything is going well and improve the project further. A leading teacher, otherwise a “supervisor” for other teachers who has more prior experience will also check up with the teachers occasionally to ensure that everything is going well. Since this process will take about 1 hour per week of your time, you are expected to be willing to invest an hour per week.

### Project Directors
#### UWC RBC Coordinator 
Enes (Türkiye)
Having understood how important English knowledge is for finding opportunities in life, Enes founded E2S in late 2022, starting the project with a team of 3 tutors. Enes currently oversees the teams in RBC and Mostar, and works on developing the project further and seeking mentorship.

#### UWC Mostar Coordinator
Lois (Hong Kong)
Lois is very concerned with the injustices around the world, and sees access to education as one. She joined E2S 2 months ago to help expand the project in Mostar. She has brought together a small team of 3 teachers to optimize the system at Mostar before expansion, and is preparing for her school-wide recruitment pitch soon.

### Our Approach
#### The Problem
Most developing or underdeveloped countries provide reasonable vocabulary and grammar lessons in English, but are unable to provide good speaking lessons. Hence, students never learn English.

#### The Significance
English knowledge is important to access global opportunities to improve one’s circumstances. If people from developing countries improve their circumstances, hopefully they will improve their families’ circumstances, and eventually, their entire communities. Lack of English knowledge prevents that.

#### The Solution
English2Success is a voluntary teaching initiative, providing free, quality conversational English education for underprivileged teens from developing countries. We aim to bridge the gap of speaking lessons to help students obtain this important tool.

### Students
#### Your First Session
What you need to know for your first session: The student you have been assigned to will be your student for at least a few sessions. This gives us the opportunity to know more about them and profile their English levels. Ask them what time they are available, set up your meeting, and share with them the link. (Don’t forget to share the links with your guides) Start off by asking them to introduce themselves (their introduction will give away their English level right away) Don’t forget to ask them if they are okay with being
recorded. If they are not, don't record it. Let your guide know if the person is not okay with it. Then, just stick with the topics! Don’t go throughthem like a list. Be interested in the student and take everything slowly. First, let them get used to speaking the language! If their level is too advanced, ask them deep philosophical questions and when they answer require them to go into the fullest detail. (Questions are provided at the end of this sheet) After the session, don’t forget to upload your recording to your page in OneDrive and fill out the simple details of the meeting in the Excel workbook

#### Note
Remember that we have a LinkTree page with all the documents

Since E2S is entirely online in its current state, I don’t see any need for funding and am therefore not requesting any funding.

I am however, interested in increasing our impact via expanding to other UWC schools and improving the E2S method, aswell as collaborating with any other changemakers who may need help with English education in their initiatives. I also would like to connect with other changemakers, and mentors in order to expand my scope of thinking and to become a better leader for this project. My interest in this fund currently lies in its ability to connect me with changemakers and mentors.

That being said, I know that my team are interested in moving E2S to make change in different ways (less online, and more on the ground,) meaning that soon a need for funding may arise. I would be happy to discuss this with my mentor in the youth action plan once an actionable plan is formed.
